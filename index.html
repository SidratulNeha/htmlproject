	<h1>MY FIRST PROJECT</h1>
<h2>This a note to self</h2>

<p>Asslamualaikum,I am starting the first step towards full stack web development. To learn web development is one of the most important decision i ever took. Web development is the first step towards the journey to make everything right in my life. I know i have to work very hard to be one of the best developers and i still feel like I am somehow lagging behind. But its okay to start slow. But consistency is the key to achieve success in any field you want. I have to consistent and work hard as possible to make this work.
Be patient, Pray to Almighty Allah and give your best,Neha.
